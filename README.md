## Hello there!

> I'm nerd-bear (Discord nerd.bear) and I have been coding in python for the last 5 years and in C++ for the last few months. I am currently 14 years old and I'm working on a mixed function software called bassil that currently has no specific use case. Also have been messing aroung with OpenGL (GLFW, GLAD, etc..)
